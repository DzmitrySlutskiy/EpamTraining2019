- https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/DefaultItemAnimator
- https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/helper/ItemTouchHelper

## Theory
- Take a look at the related documentation and learn items you didn't understand during the lesson.
- Find out how to use https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/paging/PagedListAdapter. Do not use it in HW practics!

## Practics
- Create compound view wih custom attributes for student UI item
- Create Backend data <-> RecyclerView UI relations (you can fork lesson implementation and finish it, or use your own).
Backend data could be mocked, but it should give possibility to pull, delete and edit entities.
RecyclerView should support drag'n'drop, swipe-to-delete and pagination features

# HW 11.03.2019

Compound view:
https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-compound-views-on-android--cms-22889

Navigation Drawer:
https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer#java

You need to create `Activity` with Navigation Drawer and two or more `Fragments` which you will switch after clicking in NavDrawer.

Header is a compound view with Vector icon, User name, and email. 
Icon should be clickable and each click will change icon color (can be random color or predifined list)

# HW 04.03.2019

Remember - answer on almost every question you can ask is covered at https://developer.android.com/.
If you don't understand what is service - you go to https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.
If you forgot what is BroadcastReceiver - you go to https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts and so on.
In case items described too complicated, read usual articles on native language and then go back to the offical docs.

## Theory
- Read what is foreground service.
- Read about service/broadcast limitations on new Android versions and what is LocalBroadcastManager.
- Read how to handle long-running operation using BroadcastReceiver.
- Other ways to manage back-stack - activity attributes (f.i. taskAffinity, allowTaskReparenting) and intent flags (f.i. FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP)

## Practics
- Write simple Fragment which restores its state.
- Write Activity, Service and BroadcastReceiver. Service sends data, Activity receives using Broadcast and shows it (show using Toast or logs, if you have no experience in UI). Preferable to execute at least one long-running operation, but it's optional.

## Optional for self-development
- Create custom Application class, which will provide singleton instances (any custom classes).
- Create you own implementation of IntentService.

# HW 28.02.2019
- Familiarize with code style guide.

## Part 1:
- you will work in repository with Calculator from interview:  
- make separate branch for refactoring (like *homework_28.02_clean_code*)
- align code with code style guidelines
- push changes and open pull request in your repository (from your branch to master)
- create issue with link to your pull request and mention your **Mentor**.

## Part 2:
- fork training repository
- make separate branch for refactoring
- make some changes and after that make sure that all tests are successful
- push changes and open pull request in training repository (from your branch to master)
- add link for pull request to your previous issue

The best homework request will get to the repository ðŸ˜Ž
