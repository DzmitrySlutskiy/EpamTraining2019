Nice to see you in this document 😉

I think, you feel like 🤯 or 😰 after lesson, but let's learn Android step by step


# You homework contains 2 parts:

# 1. First task (you make changes in our repository and then create pull requst):

1. Add `Android UI` lesson in project application
  * use `include` tag;
  * add mentor name for all available lessons;
  * make opening lesson screen.
    
Open `activity_lessons.xml` and will see `include` tag. It is very useful thing to reuse xml layouts or extract big layout to small components.
